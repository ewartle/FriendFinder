Friend Finder is an exciting new app that allows the user to meet new friends with similar preferences.  Through a carefully crafted set of questions, the app compares new users to existing users and makes a match.  

In order to meet your new best friend, the user must answer every survey question, including your name and a link to a photo.  

Enjoy the experience!

**This app was developed as a homework assignment with the Georgia Tech coding bootcamp.
